# India's Population Distribution by Age in 2022

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script that visualizes India's population distribution by age groups using a **stacked area chart**. The chart breaks down the population into three age groups:

1. **0 to 20 Years**
2. **21 to 64 Years**
3. **65+ Years**

The script uses **Matplotlib** and **NumPy** to generate the chart. It also includes additional information about the **total population** and **median age**.

## Files

- **population_distribution.py**: The Python script that creates the visualization.
- **README.md**: This file with instructions and details on the code.
- **requirements.txt**: (Optional) List of dependencies to install.

## Visualization Preview
This chart represents India's population distribution by age groups in 2022, with the following characteristics:

- **Yellow**: Represents the population aged 0 to 20 years.
- **Blue**: Represents the population aged 21 to 64 years.
- **Magenta**: Represents the population aged 65 and above.

In addition, the total population is displayed on the graph along with the median age.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/population-distribution
   ```
   
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python population_distribution.py
   ```

## Data
The data used in the chart is as follows:

| Age Group        | Population (Millions) | Percentage (%) |
|------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| 0 to 20 Years    | 512                   | 36.1%          |
| 21 to 64 Years   | 807                   | 57.0%          |
| 65+ Years        | 98                    | 6.9%           |

## Code Explanation

### Libraries Used
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Used to create the chart.
- `numpy`: Utilized for numerical operations.

### Key Features of the Script
1. **Stacked Area Chart**: Visualizes the population breakdown by age.
2. **Text Annotations**: Adds information about total population and median age to the chart.
3. **Legend**: Helps differentiate the age groups.

## Future Enhancements
- Add interactive elements using Plotly.
- Expand the dataset to include population data from more years.
